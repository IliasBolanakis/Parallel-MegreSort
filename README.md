# Parallel-Megre-Sort
An implementation of Merge Sort with ForkJoin Framework

The ForkJoin framework is built to design divide and conquer algorithms
in a recursive multithreaded manner. So implementation of merge sort algorithm is a great
exmaple since its meant for sorting large data sets and doing that in parallel results 
in even better performance.
